# android-permission-helper
A simple, lightweight helper class for android 6.0 runtime permissions.

Just copy-paste sample usage and you're good to go.

You can simply implement to your project, you can use it everywhere.

## Improvement
RequestFragmentPermissions added

#### add compile 'com.android.support:support-v13:24.2.1' to your app level build.gradle file to request permissions from fragment and get callback for onRequestPermissionsResult ( android.support.v13.app.FragmentCompat )
